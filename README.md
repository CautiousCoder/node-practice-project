# URL Check Project
This is a completely raw project of node js.

Here Storage data directory could not add, because we add *.local in a .gitignore file. The project data storage directory name is ".data" as a result ".data" directory couldn't add git repository. So you manually add ".data" directory of project folder. Inside ".data" directory you must add "checks", "tokens" and "users" directory.
